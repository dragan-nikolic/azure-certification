##### What is cloud computing

Cloud computing is renting resources, like storage space or CPU cycles, on another company's computers. You only pay for what you use. The company providing these services is referred to as a cloud provider. Some example providers are Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.

Compute power

* VMs
* containers
* serverless computing

Storage

##### Benefits of cloud computing

* it's cost-effective (pay-as-you-go or consumption based)
* it's scalable
  * vertical - get more powerfull machine
  * horizontal - get more machines
* it's elastic
  * automatically add or remove resources based on demand
* it's current
* it's reliable
* it's global
* it's secure

##### Compliance terms and requirements

##### Economies of scale

##### Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)

CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time.

OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There's no upfront cost. You pay for a service or product as you use it.

Cloud computing is all OpEx.

##### Cloud deployment models

There are three different cloud deployment models. A cloud deployment model defines where your data is stored and how your customers interact with it – how do they get to it, and where do the applications run? It also depends on how much of your own infrastructure you want or need to manage.

* Public
  * High scalability/agility – you don't have to buy a new server in order to scale
  * Pay-as-you-go pricing – you pay only for what you use, no CapEx costs
  * You're not responsible for maintenance or updates of the hardware
  * Minimal technical knowledge to set up and use - you can leverage the skills and expertise of the cloud provider to ensure workloads are    secure, safe, and highly available
* Private
  * You can ensure the configuration can support any scenario or legacy application
  * You have control (and responsibility) over security
  * Private clouds can meet strict security, compliance, or legal requirements
* Hybrid

##### Types of cloud services

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it.
Platform as a service (PaaS) - PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications.
Software as a service (SaaS) - SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer.
